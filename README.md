## About

The HospitalDatabase application was released in 2024. Its purpose is to assist healthcare professionals, particularly those involved in hospital data management. Our goal is to enhance their efficiency by improving healthcare data management. HospitalDatabase simplifies the recapitulation of medical records and hospital administration processes. HospitalDatabase offers four excellent features including:

1. **Read Hospital Patient**, HospitalDatabase displays the entire patient data available in the database, and you will always receive the latest updates from your database.
2. **Add Hospital Patient**, HospitalDatabase helps you register new patient records, such as their information or medical history.
3. **Change Hospital Patient**, HospitalDatabase helps you update existing patient records, such as their information or medical history.
4. **Delete Hospital Patient**, HospitalDatabase helps you delete patient records as needed.
